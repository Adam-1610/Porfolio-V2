                 Having worked for University Hospital's Birimngham
                 for 3 years, wtachimg 3 generations of collegues surpass me and progress,
                 it seemed as though my efforts were to no avail. 
                 I would work hard and get no results. 
                 With my Holiday around the corner, I was speaking to collegues in the lab. 
                 One of those people nicknamed MJ, doing a Cloud Computing course covering AWS.
                 Though at the time I had no intention of getting my feet wet in Computing,
                 I brought up the conversation to see how he was doing considering the fact 6 poeple,
                 from the haematology lab, left UHB. I can't speak for them, but it being very stressful having
                 no progress, its fair to say its a stressful envronment.

                 This being my fourth time in the United states to visit family,
                 I had seen their journeys. Having gone from living in shitty apartments in san Jose,
                 to renting a house with 12+ family members living in it,
                 to each owning their own houses in a holiday resort, yes a holiday resort is
                 how I would describe it in comparison to the humble semi-detached houses my family in the UK own,
                 this was a glimpse that anything is possible. It opened my mind to what I could achieve if I put more effort into,
                 working on myself rather then working at my job as the effort I put in there was clearly falling on blind eyes,
                 or in other words landing on deaf ears.

                 Having had a mental breakdown at my Uncles house, 
                 the next day we left for LA. 
                 The only thing on my mind was how?
                 How could I also achieve greatness? How can I get to a point where I own a mansion in,
                 an amazing neighbourhood? Was it possible for me? Nobody on my side of the pond has dreams this large!
                 They'd all think i'm crazy for not settling for less. 
                 That night in LA after our day at Universal, the track Count me out by Kendrick Lamar blasting down my
                 eardrumbs, I was surley trying to fiigure it out.
                 The voice in my head that always told me there was more out there for me then a dead end job as a 
                 medical laboratory assistant, was being awakened.

                Before our flight back to the UK, 
                I remembered a video MJ from the lab had sent me talking about the potential of Cloud Careers.
                Its no mystery to anyone that technology is the future of the world, it will always continue to advance,
                and with advnacments less jobs would become available. This has already begun with the advancement of AI.
                I watched.
                A man with a background in IT had doubled his salary, learning the cloud within 3 months,
                tripiling his salary.
                Back in the UK, I could spend my savings on a Cloud Course or choose to continue with the hopes that,
                I would finally be apprecited by my place of work.
                That I would finally progress in my current feild which i have a degree in. Biomedical Science.
                I chose to learn.

                 I purchased a course with E-careers. This also covered the same cousre MJ had done.
                 It's here I meet Charly, Mykee, Lovleen, Brad and many more who have helped me with my knowlege along the way.
                 I recently passed my forst exam within 6 months, the CCP. This with no background at all in IT.
                 I have also learned to code and coded this portfolio, which you can learn more about here:
